*** To start the backend python process ***

If needed, install anaconda2
	(https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

Use the anaconda2 python2 program to start a backend instance:
	python2 DAEDserve.py

Optionally compile to a binary (note: use the pip that is part of the anaconda2 package):
	pip install pyinstaller
Mac:	pyinstaller -Fc  --hiddenimport _sysconfigdata DAEDserve.py
Win:	pyinstaller -Fc DAEDserve.py

The executable is built in the dist folder, where it could just be double-clicked to execute

The server can be tested using "python2 testServer.py" in a separate command window.

*** To use the GUI ***

Navigate to either the pyDAEDALUSX windows or Darwin (mac) folder and double click the pyDAEDALUSX application.
